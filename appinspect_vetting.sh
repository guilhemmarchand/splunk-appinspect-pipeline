# purpose: Automated Splunk app vetting by Splunk Appinspect API
# Usage: See show_usage function
# The script exit with exit code 0 if all operations are successful and appinspect reports no failures
# Any failure at any step of the process including any number of failures during the vetting causes the script produce exit code!=0
# This simple shell script is intended to be used for automation purposes with Jenkins, CircleCI, Git Workflow and so forth.
# requirements: the script requires bash, curl and jq

# edit the script up to your needs if you wish to include or exclude specific tags, for reference:
# https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/reference/appinspecttagreference/
# https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/reference/splunkappinspectcheck/

# Current limitations of Appinspect:

# Appinspect does not currently allows to exclude specific checks, one can only exclude tags which would exclude entire sets of checks
# An easy and agile workaround is to parse the JSON response from the API, then parse the failures and decide which failures to be ignored
# depending on your preferences
# In this script context, we provide as part of the argument the native included tags, excluded tags (if any), and custom excluded checks (if any)

# included_tags / excluded_tags / excluded_checks should be given as CSV formated list
# Only included_tags is mandatory

# exit codes:

# exit 0: Appinspect is successful, failures were not reported or reported failures are excluded
# exit 100: bad parameters
# exit 1: tgz app archive not found or empty
# exit 2: Appinspect API login failed
# exit 3: Appinspect API upload has failed or timed out
# exit 4: Appinspect reported failures, which failures are not excluded checks
# exit 5: Appinspect status is unknown, likely something unexpected happened
